# Number-Guessing-Project
This is a fun Python-based terminal game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100.
The player can choose between easy (10 attempts) and hard (5 attempts) difficulty levels. 
The program gives feedback like "Too High" or "Too Low" for each guess and keeps track of remaining attempts.

Technologies Used
